# Brief Description

Welcome to the Landslide Prediction Challenge
 A landslide is the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth(soil) down a slope. As a common natural hazard, it can lead to significant losses of human lives and properties."
Hong Kong, one of the hilly and densely populated cities in the world, is frequently affected by extreme rainstorms, making it highly susceptible to rain-induced natural terrain landslides"

"The common practice of identifying landslides is visual interpretation which, however, is labor-intensive and time-consuming.,
 ***Thus, this hack will focus on automating the landslide identification process using artificial intelligence techniques***"
        "This will be achieved by using high-resolution terrain information to perform the terrain-based landslide identification. Other auxiliary data such as the lithology of the surface materials and rainfall intensification factor are also provided.
